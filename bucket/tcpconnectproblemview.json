    "description": "The TCPConnectProblemView tool monitors the TCP connections on your system and displays an alert when a software tries to initiate a TCP connection and there is no response from the server. When a problem with a TCP connection is detected , TCPConnectProblemView adds a new entry with the following information: Process Name, Process ID, Detected On (date/time), Local Port, Local IP, Remote Port, Remote IP, Remote Host. TCPConnectProblemView also allows you to automatically close any TCP socket with no response from the server, in order to decrease the time you wait for any software to display an error message (IPv4 only).",
