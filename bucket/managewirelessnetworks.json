ManageWirelessNetworks also allows you to edit a single profile with the standard editor of Windows, edit the XML of the wireless profile (For advanced users only !), quickly switch between manual and automatic mode, quickly switch between WPAPSK/WPA2PSK/AES/TKIP modes, rename the profile, rename the SSID, move profile position up and down, copy multiple wireless profiles to another wireless card on your system, and more...",
