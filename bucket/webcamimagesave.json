    "description": "WebCamImageSave is simple WebCam capture utility that allows you to easily capture a still image from your camera every number of seconds that you choose, and save it into image file (.jpg, .png, .bmp) on your disk. You can format the saved image filename with the date/time that the image was taken according to your preference, for example: c:\\images\\img20110725_123256.jpg WebCamImageSave also adds a label with the date/time that the image was captured into the image, by using the font, color, and date/time format that you choose. You can also capture a single camera image from command-line, without displaying any user interface.",
